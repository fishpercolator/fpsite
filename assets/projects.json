His commitment to test driven development means your software will be stable and scaleable and his agile approach to scoping out features forces you, as a product owner, to better define how you think your software should work.</p><p>\"Rich also cares, a lot! Despite his expertise this is the one characteristic that has made working with him a real pleasure. His passion  is not just for coding, but making a difference in the world and that has been evident throughout our working relationship.</p><p>\"We’re looking forward to working with Rich more in the future and kind of hope you don’t, so we can have him all to ourself!\"</p><p>– <strong>David Rose</strong>, CEO</p></blockquote>"
