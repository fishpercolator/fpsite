Honesty is so important to us: we want to make sure you understand *why* and *how* things work, both in terms of development and in the way we do business.\n\nWe're huge fans of Plain English, and this is reflected in our communication style and even our contracts.\n\nWe're in this to have fun, and we want you to have fun working with us too. So apologies in advance for all the Twin Peaks and Kate Bush references."

    "description": "When you're running a business you need to know it can cope as your userbase grows. Software designed on a small scale is often useless once you reach thousands of users and results in costly rewrites.\n\nWe build web applications to the [Twelve-Factor specification](https://12factor.net/), which means they are designed to grow as your userbase grows, without the need for rewriting. Applications built to this specification are also highly portable, and can equally run on the tiniest virtual server or a scalable cloud like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)."

    "description": "We don't believe in big six-month projects with all the requirements agreed up-front. With software, it's hard to know what comes next until you and your users have seen and used what's been done so far.\n\nWe develop iteratively, typically doing around 35-40 hours' work on a project at a time. At the end of a phase, you'll have working software you can play with and give to your users, and then we can design the next phase together.\n\nThis also helps us charge appropriately: when a small set of requirements for a phase has been agreed up-front, we can also set a fixed price for that phase, so there are no nasty surprises at the end."

There will always be updates, new features and new customers.\n\nCode written by agencies often bears the label 'legacy code', sure to strike fear into the hearts of any new developers you recruit to work on it in the future.\n\nWe're extremely aware of this and so we try to create the most reusable and portable code possible, following practices like convention-over-configuration, the Twelve-Factor specification and behaviour-driven development, all of which will help anything we make for you fit into your ecosystem as comfortably as it can."

It's easy to miss things like systemic bias or inaccessbility when designing software, and we'll be there trying our hardest to point them out when we see them in designs, or consult with the affected group.\n\nWe also believe government should be there to protect the vulnerable, and to that end we pay all our taxes, whether or not they are spent wisely by the people in power."
