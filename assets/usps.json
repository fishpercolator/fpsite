At the end of a phase, you'll have working software you can play with and give to your users, and then we can design the next phase together.</p><p>This also helps us charge appropriately: when a small set of requirements for a phase has been agreed up-front, we can also set a fixed price for that phase, so there are no nasty surprises at the end.</p>"
